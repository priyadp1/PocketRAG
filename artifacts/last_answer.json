  "answer": "The Monroe Doctrine laid the groundwork for American expansion and established a framework of non-interference in transatlantic relations. It outlined a regionalist view of world affairs and reflected American culture and national identity. The period between 1817 and 1829 is divided into the \"Era of Good Feelings\" under James Monroe and the \"Era of Hard Feelings\" under John Quincy Adams. The principles of the Monroe Doctrine include anti-colonization, non-intervention, self-defense, and American nationalism. [S2]"
