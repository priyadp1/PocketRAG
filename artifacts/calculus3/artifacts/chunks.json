M\nH L Q\n2. Vocabulary.\n(a) A function of two variables has a local maximum at (a,b) if\nf(x,y) ≤f(a,b)\nwhen (x,y) is near (a,b). The number f(a,b) is called a local maximum value.\n(b) If f(x,y) ≥f(a,b) when (x,y) is near (a,b), then f(a,b) is a local minimum value.\n(c) If f(x,y) ≤f(a,b) for all points (x,y) in the domain of f, then f has an absolute maximum at\n(a,b).\n(d) If f(x,y) ≥f(a,b) for all points (x,y) in the domain of f, then f has an absolute minimum at\n(a,b).\n3. Theorem. If f has a local maximum or minimum at (a,b) and the ﬁrst-order partial derivatives of f\nexist there, then\nfx(a,b) = 0 and fy(a,b) = 0.\n4. Critical Point. A point (a,b) is called a critical point of f if\nfx(a,b) = fy(a,b) = 0,\nor if one of these partials does not exist.\nPART 14: P ARTIAL DERIVATIVES LECTURE 14.7 M AXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES 88\n5. BIG Question. How do we decide if a critical point is a local maximum or a local minimum?\n6. Second Derivative Test. Suppose the second partial derivatives of f are continuous on a disk with\ncentre (a,b), and suppose that fx(a,b) = 0 and fy(a,b) = 0 (that is, (a,b) is a critical point of f). Let\nD= fxx(a,b)fyy(a,b) −[fxy(a,b)]2.\nThen\n(a) if D> 0 and fxx(a,b) >0 = ⇒ f has a local minimum at (a,b)\n(b) if D> 0 and fxx(a,b) <0 = ⇒ f has a local maximum at (a,b)\n(c) if D< 0 = ⇒ f has neither a local minimum nor a\nlocal maximum at (a,b).\nInstead, f has a saddle point at (a,b).\n(d) if D= 0 = ⇒ Test is inconclusive.\nPART 14: P ARTIAL DERIVATIVES LECTURE 14.7 M AXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES 89\n7.

A land bridge as much as 1,500km \nwide connected Asia and North America. By 12,000 years ago, humans were living \nthroughout much of the Western Hemisphere.

The actual fact is that legal freedom for all slaves in the United States did \nnot come until the final passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in December of 1865. \nLincoln was a strong supporter of the amendment, but he was assassinated before its final \nenactment. \n \n3.

Wisest US President \nPoliticians love to quote Abraham Lincoln because Lincoln is considered America's \nwisest president. A major effect Lincoln has on the U.S. today is simply through the good \nexample he set when it came to leadership and integrity. \n \n5. Fugitive Slave Act \nTo soften the attitude of peoples in south Lincoln supported the Fugitive Slave Law or \nFugitive Slave Act which was passed in 1850. This was one of the most controversial acts \nof the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a \"slave power conspiracy\". It \ndeclared that all runaway slaves will be brought back to their masters. \n \n6. Good Relations with Cabinet \nLincoln managed excellent relations with his advisors, cabinet and military. When ever, \nthere was disagreement among advisors and he, his leadership style often involved telling \nHistory of USA \nNational Officers Academy (0323-5045013) 73 \na story that demonstrated his point. Lots of times this method worked, and cabinet \nadmired and respected him for it. He could virtually disarm his enemies with his highly \nmoralistic, skillful leadership. Lincoln possessed qualities of kindness and compassion \ncombined with wisdom. In fact, one of his nicknames was \"Father Abraham.\" \n \n7. Foreign Policy \nThe Major achievement of Lincoln foreign policy was that it geared toward preventing \nforeign intervention in the Civil War.

The treaty proposed that all \nnations would have equal rights to \naccess Chinese ports for trade and \nbusiness purposes.

The provisions of the act called \nfor the signing of the Treaty of New Echota in 1838; however, most of the Cherokee \ntribes did not accept the treaty and refused to leave. Therefore, President Martin Van \nBuren dispatched troops to gather approximately 17,000 Cherokees into camps and then \nforce their relocation west. An estimated 4,000 Cherokees died during the relocation — \nmost in the camps from disease. \n \nThe phrase \"Trail of Tears\" — or as the Cherokees call it, \"The Trail Where They Cried\" \n— can also refer to the forced relocation of other Native American tribes — most notably \nthe Choctaw Nation, which also suffered thousands of deaths in its removal from \nMississippi to Oklahoma in the 1830s. \nThe actual Trail of Tears site is a historic park in Kentucky along the trail the Cherokees \nfollowed on their long migration west.
